# AutoCar--Final-project-
This project simulates a self-driving car environment using neural networks for AI decision-making. 
It features a dynamic road system, realistic car physics, and obstacle detection via sensors. The neural network learns to navigate effectively, 
with a visualization component to display the network's architecture and performance metrics.

# Saving the AI Brain:
After running the simulation, you’ll have the option to save the AI's learning progress. 
Look for a “Save Brain” button on the interface.
Click this to save the AI’s best brain so after you refresh they will take the mutation from the best brain.
