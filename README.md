# AutoCar-project
This project simulates a self-driving car environment using neural networks for AI decision-making. 
It features a dynamic road system, realistic car physics, and obstacle detection via sensors. The neural network learns to navigate effectively, 
with a visualization component to display the network's architecture and performance metrics.

# Saving the AI Brain:
After running the simulation, you’ll have the option to save the AI's learning progress. 
Look for a “Save Brain” button on the interface.
Click this to save the AI’s best brain so after you refresh they will take the mutation from the best brain.

# Visualizing Learning Progress:
While the AI is learning, you’ll see visual indicators of its performance. This might include:
Graphs showing the AI’s scores over time.
Metrics that display how many successful actions the AI has taken.
These visuals help you understand how well the AI is learning and improving.

# Monitoring Progress:
Keep an eye on the real-time statistics displayed on the screen. This may include current scores, best scores, and other performance indicators that show how the AI is evolving as it learns to drive.
